1. **Define Requirements:** Clearly outline the requirements and objectives of the project. Make sure you understand the needs of the users and stakeholders.

2. **Design the Database:**
   - Design the database schema based on the data model you outlined earlier.
   - Choose a database system (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, SQLite) and set it up.
   - Create the necessary tables and establish relationships between them.

3. **Implement the Data Layer:**
   - Choose or implement an ORM framework for working with the database.
   - Create classes or entities that map to the database tables.
   - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for interacting with the database.

4. **Develop the Desktop Application:**
   - Choose the technology stack for desktop application development (e.g., WPF or MAUI).
   - Design the user interface for the administration panel.
   - Implement functionality for managing applications and school offerings.
   - Incorporate asynchronous programming and threading where necessary for performance optimization.

5. **Build the Web Application:**
   - Select ASP.NET Core for web development.
   - Design the user interface for the web form.
   - Implement form validation and AJAX functionality for autocomplete suggestions.
   - Ensure security measures such as input validation and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).

6. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual components.
   - Perform integration testing to validate the interactions between different parts of the system.
   - Conduct user acceptance testing to ensure the application meets the requirements.

7. **Documentation and Deployment:**
   - Document the project, including the architecture, code structure, and how to set up and deploy the application.
   - Prepare for deployment to production environments, considering factors such as server configuration, scalability, and maintenance.

8. **Iterate and Improve:**
   - Gather feedback from users and stakeholders.
   - Address any issues or feature requests that arise.
   - Continuously improve the application based on feedback and changing requirements.
